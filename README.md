# Parameters-estimation-from-remote-sensing-data-for-the-generation-of-virtual-3D-city-models

Virtual 3D city generation is an essential element in various economical areas such as video games, virtual environments for the film industry, electro-magnetic propagation for the design of telecommunication infrastructures, pollution propagation estimation... Traditionally it must be constructed by hand in a 3D application by a human operator. While this approach gives the operator full control, it requires skills and a lot of time to complete an entire city. In the last years, several tools have been proposed for the automation of the process. However, many param- eters such as the width and the length of the roads and the size and the height of the buildings are still set by the operator or randomly generated. 

The purpose of this project is to develop new tools for the estimation of these parameters from the automated analysis of remote sensing data. High resolution aerial imagery with vertical and oblique viewing angle are convenient sources to estimate the distribution of morphological parameters related to the shape of the terrain, the size and the height of the buildings, and the structure of the road network. 

This work has been performed in the research team Image, Modeling, Analysis, Geometry, Synthesis (IMAGES) of the department of Image, Data, Signal department [IDS] of Télécom Paristech in Paris (France).
